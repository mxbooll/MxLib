  // This will fix a bug where the epub child container will try to resize from the size of the parent.
  // The issue is when double click resizing (Dblclicking the titlebar of the browser), the epubContainer will resize first, but the
  // previous rendition will still be rendered. This causes an overflow. By default the height of the epubContainer will match that
  // of what is needed for the child. By setting overflow to hidden, it prevents that bug. However, this may cause issues in the future...
